# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-in-python
This is a basic tic tac toe game in python using Jupyter Notebooks
If you want to run the .py file on any other python IDE just remover the "from IPython.display import clear_output" and clear_output() from the display_board funtion
This is just to clear the displayboard after every run.
